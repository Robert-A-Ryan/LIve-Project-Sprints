I participated in a two week sprint with a development team to start a new project (Theatre CMS) using C# ASP.Net MVC.
TheatreCMS is an application that will manage the website for a theater company. Users will be able to update the website for current and upcoming shows and archive past performances. They will be able to do this without coding knowledge.
This demonstrated what it is like working with a team to achieve complex solutions.
We used Azur DevOps for our project manager and Git to manage our stories and preserve the working code.

CREATE DISPLAY INFO CLASS
Tasked with creating the class where Play Promotion Images would be stored.
Created a new class (DisplayImage) to the project.
In this file the structure for the database table was built.
Used Entity Framework to create the controller and views for this model
Modified the create page to collect the information needed and made sure that it took that info and saved it in the database.

SET UP A COLOR PALETTE
Set up the Color Palette for use on our website
Using variables in our CSS made it easier to change the color palette in the future
